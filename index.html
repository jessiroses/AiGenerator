        Book Recommendation: The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood
        <div>
          When PhD candidate Olive Smith fakes a relationship with a hotshot
          professor to prove to her best friend that she's moved on, she never
          expects it to lead to real feelings. Full of witty banter, awkward
          science lab moments, and slow-burn romance, The Love Hypothesis is
          perfect for fans of fake-dating tropes and geeky charm.
